# MetalArchive-ML-Project
A machine learning project of metalarchive data

## Motivation & Objective
metal-archives.com is one of the largest website to search for metal band info. There are more than 130,000 band records on the site and users are able to write reviews of albums. 

The goal of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the review score for the albums.

## Data Exploration
(The data from the site was huge so only death metal bands data were used)
